# Notifymatters Mattermost plugin

This plugin for Mattermost exposes a postMessage API which allows Mattermost
to trigger desktop notifications when Mattermost is loaded inside an iframe.

## Mattermost compatibility

This plugin is using the plugin framework originally introduced in Mattermost 4.5.0. We recommend keeping up to date with Mattermost, since we are only performing tests against the latest Mattermost release. Please see the Kopano [Mattermost manual](https://documentation.kopano.io/kopano_mattermost_manual/) on how to use our deb and rpm packages to easily stay up to date with your Mattermost installation.

**Important notice:** Mattermost has announced breaking changes to their plugin framework with version 5.2.0. As of writing this our plugin is not yet compatible with the new plugin framework. Once the plugin has been updated it will only be compatible with Mattermost 5.2.0 and upwards. Please check the [download archive](https://download.kopano.io/community/mattermost-plugin-notifymatters:/) for older releases.
